# ATM-Simulator
This is a desktop application which simulates the working of ATM machine. 
There is an option to insert card number and pin to access the functionalities instead of inserting card in real ATM machine.
It is developed using Java and MySQL on eclipse IDE.

There is one problem though, I have added dbCon method to establish connection with database in each file. So if database connection string is to be changed it has to be changed in each file.

DB folder contains the required database tables with data.
